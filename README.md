# libre-api-pg

This is a repo to explore the use of the libre link api.

Currently this repo contains:
- get_data.py script that is used to download the cgm and logbook data
- app.py that is a streamlit app to show the percent time in range over the last 24 hours, as to date (22/08/23) it is no longer available to be seen in the librelink app. My wife really liked that feature.
